# Express-JS
To learn express js, I follow this YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQDioScEMUhl7asrdpettWLg4g7xtWBUw<br>

Here I upload that code, which were practiced during this playlist.
<br>
Before Run this code you have to follow this code in VSCode:<br>
npm install express
# Commands

    npm init
    npm install express
    npm install nodemon
    npm install express nodemon
    node index.js
    nodemon index.js
Those Command I use in VSCode to run a JS file where file name is index.
